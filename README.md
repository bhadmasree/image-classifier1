# Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project is a simple image classification model built using TensorFlow and trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## About
The model learns to classify 32x32 color images into 10 categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, and dogs.

## How to run
The project is implemented as a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) and can be run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for free, without any setup.

Just open the notebook in Colab and run all cells.

## Libraries used
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Results
The model achieves about 70% accuracy after 10 epochs of training.
